> **In kiln:** agent-skills' skills/planning-and-task-breakdown/SKILL.md (D190), edited where it would work outside kiln: the plan and its tasks are one file, `.kiln/work/<id>/plan.md`, written with kiln-writing-plans' template (no `tasks/` directory, no tracker items); the checkpoints keep their verification and drop "review with human before proceeding", because IMPLEMENT runs continuously and the plan gate is where the human reviews. Its task fields — acceptance criteria, verification, dependencies, files, scope — go into each task of kiln's template. A skill it names is the file of that name in kiln's skills.

# Planning and Task Breakdown

## Overview

Decompose work into small, verifiable tasks with explicit acceptance criteria. Good task breakdown is the difference between an agent that completes work reliably and one that produces a tangled mess. Every task should be small enough to implement, test, and verify in a single focused session.

## When to Use

- You have a spec and need to break it into implementable units
- A task feels too large or vague to start
- Work needs to be parallelized across multiple agents or sessions
- You need to communicate scope to a human
- The implementation order isn't obvious

**When NOT to use:** Single-file changes with obvious scope, or when the spec already contains well-defined tasks.

## The Planning Process

### Step 1: Enter Plan Mode

Before writing any code, operate in read-only mode:

- Read the spec and relevant codebase sections
- Identify existing patterns and conventions
- Map dependencies between components
- Note risks and unknowns

**Do NOT write code during planning.** The output is the plan document, `.kiln/work/<id>/plan.md`, whose tasks are the task list, not implementation.

### Step 2: Identify the Dependency Graph

Map what depends on what:

```
Database schema
    │
    ├── API models/types
    │       │
    │       ├── API endpoints
    │       │       │
    │       │       └── Frontend API client
    │       │               │
    │       │               └── UI components
    │       │
    │       └── Validation logic
    │
    └── Seed data / migrations
```

Implementation order follows the dependency graph bottom-up: build foundations first.

### Step 3: Slice Vertically

Instead of building all the database, then all the API, then all the UI — build one complete feature path at a time:

**Bad (horizontal slicing):**
```
Task 1: Build entire database schema
Task 2: Build all API endpoints
Task 3: Build all UI components
Task 4: Connect everything
```

**Good (vertical slicing):**
```
Task 1: User can create an account (schema + API + UI for registration)
Task 2: User can log in (auth schema + API + UI for login)
Task 3: User can create a task (task schema + API + UI for creation)
Task 4: User can view task list (query + API + UI for list view)
```

Each vertical slice delivers working, testable functionality.

### Step 4: Write Tasks

Each task follows this structure, whether it lands in the markdown task list or as an item in an external tracker (see Output Files):

```markdown
## Task [N]: [Short descriptive title]

**Description:** One paragraph explaining what this task accomplishes.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific, testable condition]
- [ ] [Specific, testable condition]

**Verification:**
- [ ] Tests pass: [the repository's focused-test command]
- [ ] Build succeeds: [the repository's build command]
- [ ] Manual check: [description of what to verify]

**Dependencies:** [Task numbers this depends on, or "None"]

**Files likely touched:**
- `src/path/to/file.ts`
- `tests/path/to/test.ts`

**Estimated scope:** [Small: 1-2 files | Medium: 3-5 files | Large: 5+ files]
```

### Step 5: Order and Checkpoint

Arrange tasks so that:

1. Dependencies are satisfied (build foundation first)
2. Each task leaves the system in a working state
3. Verification checkpoints occur after every 2-3 tasks
4. High-risk tasks are early (fail fast)

Add explicit checkpoints to the plan:

```markdown
## Checkpoint: After Tasks 1-3
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Application builds without errors
- [ ] Core user flow works end-to-end
```

## Task Sizing Guidelines

| Size | Files | Scope | Example |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| **XS** | 1 | Single function or config change | Add a validation rule |
| **S** | 1-2 | One component or endpoint | Add a new API endpoint |
| **M** | 3-5 | One feature slice | User registration flow |
| **L** | 5-8 | Multi-component feature | Search with filtering and pagination |
| **XL** | 8+ | **Too large — break it down further** | — |

If a task is L or larger, it should be broken into smaller tasks. An agent performs best on S and M tasks.

**When to break a task down further:**
- It would take more than one focused session (roughly 2+ hours of agent work)
- You cannot describe the acceptance criteria in 3 or fewer bullet points
- It touches two or more independent subsystems (e.g., auth and billing)
- You find yourself writing "and" in the task title (a sign it is two tasks)

## Output Files

- **Plan document and task list:** one file, `.kiln/work/<id>/plan.md`, written with kiln-writing-plans' template. The plan gate hashes it, so it is the only place the tasks live: no `tasks/` directory, and no tracker items (kiln writes to no tracker, D13).

## Plan Document Template

kiln-writing-plans' header and task structure are the plan's template, and there is no second
one: its Goal, Risk flags, I/O & Edge-Case Matrix, Review Focus and tasks carry what this skill
asks for. Each task gets the fields from Step 4 — acceptance criteria, verification,
dependencies, files, size — and the checkpoints between phases are verification steps in the
task that ends the phase. Risks go in Global Constraints or Review Focus; an open question is
asked before the plan gate, not left in the plan.

## Parallelization Opportunities

When multiple agents or sessions are available:

- **Safe to parallelize:** Independent feature slices, tests for already-implemented features, documentation
- **Must be sequential:** Database migrations, shared state changes, dependency chains
- **Needs coordination:** Features that share an API contract (define the contract first, then parallelize)

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll figure it out as I go" | That's how you end up with a tangled mess and rework. 10 minutes of planning saves hours. |
| "The tasks are obvious" | Write them down anyway. Explicit tasks surface hidden dependencies and forgotten edge cases. |
| "Planning is overhead" | Planning is the task. Implementation without a plan is just typing. |
| "I can hold it all in my head" | Context windows are finite. Written plans survive session boundaries and compaction. |

## Red Flags

- Starting implementation without a written task list
- Tasks that say "implement the feature" without acceptance criteria
- No verification steps in the plan
- All tasks are XL-sized
- No checkpoints between tasks
- Dependency order isn't considered

## Verification

Before starting implementation, confirm:

- [ ] Every task has acceptance criteria
- [ ] Every task has a verification step
- [ ] Task dependencies are identified and ordered correctly
- [ ] Tasks are recorded in `.kiln/work/<id>/plan.md`
- [ ] No task touches more than ~5 files
- [ ] Checkpoints exist between major phases
- [ ] The plan is ready for the plan gate, where the human approves it

Acceptance criteria are per-task and answer "did we build the right thing?". They sit on top of the project-wide Definition of Done, the standing bar every task clears before it counts as done. See `../../references/definition-of-done.md`.
